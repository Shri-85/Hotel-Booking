# Hotel Booking
## Problem Statement
 To develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts hotel  cancellations based on various features such 
 as booking lead time,  type of hotel, arrival date , and customer demographics.
 The objective is to assist hotel  management in optimizing their operations , revenue management,
  and customer service by  identifying potential cancellations in advance and implementing appropriate strategies 
  to mitigate their impact.
   ## Objectives

1.Predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled before the arrival date.
2.Identify the key factors influencing booking cancellations.
3.Provide actionable insights to hotel management for better decision-making and resource allocation.
4.Optimize revenue management strategies by minimizing the negative impact of cancellations on hotel revenue.
5.Improve customer satisfaction and retention by enhancing booking processes and service quality.

## Research Question
1.What are variable that affect hotel reservation cancellation?
2.How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
3.how will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?


## Hypothesis
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

## Results/Findings
The bar graph shows the percentage of reservation that are canceled and those that are not.It shows 
that  significant number of reservations that have not been canceled.There are still 37% of clients who canceled 
their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotels earning

Comparatively, city hotels exhibit a higher volume of bookings than resort hotels. This discrepancy may be attributed to the likelihood that resort accommodations are generally more expensive than their city counterparts."

             The line graph illustrates fluctuations in the average daily rate between city and resort hotels across different days/months. Notably, there are instances where the average daily rate for a city hotel is lower than that of a resort hotel, and on some occasions, it even dips further. Conversely, the average daily rate for the resort hotel is consistently higher on average, indicating a potentially exponential increase, suggestive of peak holiday season demand.

        The grouped bar graph depicts the analysis of reservation levels across different months based on reservation status. Notably, the month of August exhibits the highest number of confirmed reservations and the lowest number of canceled reservations. Conversely, September shows a low number of canceled reservations. However, in January, there is a surge in canceled reservations, indicating a peak period for cancellations.

      The bar graph clearly illustrates a correlation between the frequency of cancellations and the price of accommodations. Cancellations are most prevalent when prices are at their highest and least common when they are at their lowest. This suggests that the cost of accommodation plays a significant role in influencing cancellations, indicating that higher prices may deter guests from confirming their reservations.

            Portugal is top country with highest number of cancellation.

                    The graph conclusively shows that reservations are more likely to be canceled when the average daily rate is higher. This provides strong evidence that higher prices indeed lead to increased cancellation rates.

## Suggestions
1.Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Implement a dynamic pricing strategy where room rates are adjusted based on demand and booking patterns. During periods of low demand, offer discounts or special promotions to incentivize bookings and reduce the likelihood of cancellations.

2.Early Booking Discounts: Encourage guests to book early by offering discounts or additional perks for reservations made well in advance. This can help stabilize booking patterns and reduce last-minute cancellations.

3.Flexible Cancellation Policies: Offer flexible cancellation policies that allow guests to cancel or modify their reservations without penalty within a certain timeframe. This can provide guests with peace of mind and encourage them to book even when uncertain about their travel plans.
Value-added Services: Enhance the perceived value of the accommodation by offering complimentary services or amenities that justify the higher price. This could include complimentary breakfast, airport transfers, or access to leisure facilities.

4.Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Target marketing campaigns towards specific segments of guests who are less price-sensitive and more likely to commit to their reservations. This could include business travelers, loyal customers, or guests seeking luxury experiences.

5.Customer Feedback Analysis: Analyze customer feedback and reviews to identify any common pain points or areas for improvement that may be contributing to cancellations. Addressing these issues can help enhance the overall guest experience and reduce cancellations.
